Hello everyone!

Welcome to the first blog post on the freeCodeCamp Norman site! We plan on having members submit posts through pull requests to the source code of the site as we are running on Gatsby. If you're a member of the group, feel free to suggest topics that you'd like to see on the blog by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/freecodecampnorman/freecodecampnorman.github.io/issues/new/choose) or submit a pull request with a post of your own and one of the maintainers will review it.

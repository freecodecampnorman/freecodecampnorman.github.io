Hello everyone! It is October once again and that means it's time for Hacktoberfest!

If you haven't participated in Hacktoberfest before, it is an annual event put on by DigitalOcean to promote open source software. If you make four pull requests on GitHub over throughout the month, DigitalOcean will send you a nice T-shirt with that year's design along with some nice stickers! If you're already familiar with making pull requests on GitHub, [sign up here now](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/register) and get started right away!

If you haven't made a pull request before or have not used GitHub yet, now is a great time to get your feet wet! [Sign up for a GitHub account](https://github.com/join) and register at the link above to get started. Here are a few resources to help you get started:

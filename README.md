## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Clone the site locally**

    Either download the zip and extract the contents or use git to clone a copy locally.

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/freecodecampnorman/freecodecampnorman.github.io
    ```

1.  **Install the Gatsby CLI**

    Install the Gatsby CLI to run the commands for development.

    ```shell
    npm i -g gatsby-cli
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd freecodecampnorman.github.io/
    npm install
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-default-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## ðŸŽ“ Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Here are some places to start:

-   **For most developers, we recommend starting with our [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

-   **To dive straight into code samples, head [to our documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.
